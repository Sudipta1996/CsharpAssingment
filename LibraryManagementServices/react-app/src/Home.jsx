               Libraries are cornerstones of our communities as hubs for knowledge, research, history, and so much more. They are places where people can connect with others and invest in their own future. We know that libraries are a huge resource to every community, but how about our online communities?

 

Your library’s website isn’t just a website, it’s an entirely separate branch of your library system. As such, it’s important to give your patrons an online experience with the same value as they would find walking through the doors of their local library. It should be clean, vibrant, and accessible to all. It should be a place where information and resources are easy to locate, with the newest and most popular things offered right up front. It should be a place that your patrons feel excited and happy to use. It’s more than a website, it’s your digital library branch.

 

With that in mind, we’ve gathered some of our favorite library websites that showcase some of the best aspects of a great digital library branch. Below, you’ll see a roundup of some of the best websites in some of the following categories:
